"""
Verifies that an incoming Pub/Sub push notification genuinely originated
from Google and was not tampered with in transit, before any downstream
processing (fetch, OCR, chunking, LLM calls) is allowed to run.

This is the cheapest possible check in the whole pipeline, so it sits
first in routers/gmail_webhook.py -- reject fast, before spending any
real work on an untrusted request.
